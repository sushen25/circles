-- The payload keys an action may carry. Anything else is refused, not ignored:
-- a caller that sends `quorum` with a `cancel` has misunderstood something,
-- and silently dropping it would let the misunderstanding ship.
--
-- `confirm` carries the confirmation's details as well as the candidate,
-- because `transition_plan` writes the confirmation row itself.

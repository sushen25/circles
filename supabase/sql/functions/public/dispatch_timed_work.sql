-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The work a clock creates, discovered from data rather than from a timer
-- (architecture §9.3).
--
-- Four things, every run, all of them queries:
--
-- 1. **A deadline that has passed.** Nothing emits `planning.deadline_passed`
--    — it is not a transition, and S1-11 left it for the sweep to raise. It is
--    emitted into the outbox rather than turned into a job here, so that the
--    one place events become notifications stays the drain. Once per
--    **deadline**, not once per plan: "give it one more day" (spec §5.7) moves
--    the deadline out and it passes again, and a marker keyed on the plan
--    would announce the second one to nobody. The outbox is still the marker,
--    which holds because a plan cannot outlive its own window by the thirty
--    days retention keeps events for (rule 2 below closes it long before).
--
-- 2. **A plan whose last possible start has gone.** Spec §9: "the plan stays
--    decidable until the last candidate start, then expires." The last start
--    is `public.plan_last_possible_start` — the same function the deadline
--    constraint uses, so the moment a plan stops being decidable and the
--    moment it may no longer be answered are one definition rather than two.
--    `expire` has no guards, so the actor is null: nobody did this, the window
--    closed.
--
-- 3. **A plan whose candidate set is stale.** After ADR 0018 every answer
--    recalculates in the request that caused it, and the cases with no request
--    to attach to are this function's: a member removed by a trigger, a
--    recalculation that lost its compare-and-set. Found by asking which plans
--    have no `candidate_sets` row at the version they are on (S1-16).
--
-- 4. **A deadline 24 hours out.** The plans, not the people: who is owed a
--    reminder is `recipientsFor('deadline_approaching')`'s answer and belongs
--    in the domain.
--
-- Each transition is attempted on its own and a refusal is counted rather than
-- thrown: a plan that was confirmed between the select and the update is a
-- race with a correct outcome, and losing it must not abandon the rest of the
-- batch.

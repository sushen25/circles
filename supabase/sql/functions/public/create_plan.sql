-- A plan comes into existence in `draft` and is moved out of it by the machine.
--
-- Not "insert with state `collecting`". `draft → create_named → collecting` is a
-- row in `planning.transitions`, with its guards (an active member, a saved
-- place — ADR 0004) and its event (`planning.plan_created`) attached to it. A
-- function that set the state itself would be a second creation path with its
-- own idea of who may create and whether anybody is told; `enforce_state_through_transition`
-- refuses that in any case. So: insert the draft, address it to people, hand it
-- to `transition_plan`. The seed has done it this way since 0003.
--
-- Everything arriving here is already resolved. The presets, the default
-- deadline and the default quorum are `packages/domain`'s — `resolvePreset`,
-- `defaultDeadline`, `quorumFor` — and the Edge Function applies them before
-- calling. This function does not second-guess those numbers; it records them,
-- and the table's own constraints (a viable band, a deadline before the last
-- possible start) are what stop an impossible plan.
--
-- The short code is generated here for the reason `create_circle` generates
-- one: a collision has to be retried against the table, which only the database
-- can see.
--
-- In `public`, although it is planning's work and calls planning's machine.
-- Two reasons, and either alone would settle it: PostgREST exposes `public` and
-- nothing else, so a function anywhere else cannot be called by a client at all;
-- and `070_communication_jobs.sql` asserts that *no* function outside `public` is
-- callable by a client role, which is the invariant that keeps `planning`,
-- `private` and `jobs` reachable only through functions like this one. What
-- stays in `planning` is what only SQL calls: `transition_plan`, `allowed_keys`,
-- `event_for`, `candidate_is_eligible`.

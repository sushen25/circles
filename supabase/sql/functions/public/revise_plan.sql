-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Editing a plan, and unpicking a confirmed one.
--
-- Two lines of work and three reasons to exist. `planning.transition_plan` is in
-- `planning`, which PostgREST does not expose and which
-- `070_communication_jobs.sql` asserts no client may call. The actor has to be
-- `auth.uid()` rather than an argument — `transition_plan` takes one, because
-- SQL callers know who they are acting for, and a client-callable function that
-- did the same would let a caller name somebody else (the lesson S1-13 paid for
-- twice). And the action is fixed to the three this endpoint is for, each
-- derived from what is actually being changed: a wrapper that passed an action
-- through would let a client `confirm` or `expire` a plan without meeting the
-- checks those have endpoints for.
--
-- Everything else is `transition_plan`'s: the organiser guard, the revision
-- bump, `planning.plan_revised` or `confirmation.meetup_rescheduled`, and —
-- through `supersede_on_leaving_confirmed` — the confirmation a reopen has to
-- take with it.

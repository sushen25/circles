-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- One membership, one circle, from one identity to another.
--
-- Both paths that move a membership use this: `reattach_member`, when a guest
-- comes back with no session (ADR 0006), and `claim_identity`, when somebody
-- saves their place and turns out to have had a permanent identity already.
-- One copy, because the cost of two is a table moved by one of them and left
-- behind by the other — and "left behind" means a guest who reattaches and
-- finds their answers gone.
--
-- It decides nothing. Who may move what is the caller's question: this assumes
-- it has already been answered and does the writing.
--
-- `member_dayparts` and any re-entry token for the membership are absent below
-- because they move themselves — both reference `circle_members` with
-- `on update cascade`, which 0006 and 0007 put there for this moment.
--
-- `analytics.events` is also deliberately absent, and it is the one table here
-- that *should* be: an event is a record of something that happened to an
-- identity at a time, and rewriting it would be rewriting history rather than
-- following a person. It has no foreign key to `auth.users`, so nothing
-- cascades it away either.

  -- there to be found. Spending it is what stops it being a bypass; the trigger

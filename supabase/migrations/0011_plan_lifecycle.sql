-- 0011 — the plan lifecycle's application layer (S1-15).
--
-- No new tables. Everything a plan needs already exists: `plans` and its two
-- audience tables from 0003, the state machine and `planning.transition_plan`
-- from 0003 and 0004, `circle_invites` from 0002. What was missing was the way
-- in — three definer functions that a client may call and that do the several
-- writes each of these use cases is made of.
--
--   `public.issue_invite`        the circle's one live link, and resetting it
--   `public.create_plan`         a draft, its audience, and the transition out
--   `public.reask_audience`      what an edit would cost, as facts
--
-- All three in `public`, which is not where planning's work belongs but is the
-- only schema PostgREST exposes — and `070_communication_jobs.sql` asserts that
-- nothing outside it is client-callable. `planning` keeps what only SQL calls.
--
-- Editing, cancelling and reopening need nothing new: they are
-- `planning.transition_plan(plan, 'edit' | 'cancel' | 'reopen', actor, payload)`,
-- which already has the guards, the revision bump, the event and — through
-- `supersede_on_leaving_confirmed` — the confirmation that has to go with them.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The state machine, reseeded.
--
-- 0003 has shipped, so a domain change cannot be regenerated in place — the
-- generator's own header says as much, and `MIGRATION` in
-- `scripts/gen-transitions.mjs` now points here. The table is emptied and
-- rewritten rather than patched: it is a mirror of
-- `packages/domain/src/planning/state-machine.ts`, and a mirror with one row
-- amended by hand is no longer one.
--
-- What changed: `adjust`, from `collecting` and from `ready`, which is how the
-- quorum and the deadline move without a new revision (spec §5.3).

-- A plan comes into existence in `draft` and is moved out of it by the machine.
--
-- Not "insert with state `collecting`". `draft → create_named → collecting` is a
-- row in `planning.transitions`, with its guards (an active member, a saved
-- place — ADR 0004) and its event (`planning.plan_created`) attached to it. A
-- function that set the state itself would be a second creation path with its
-- own idea of who may create and whether anybody is told; `enforce_state_through_transition`
-- refuses that in any case. So: insert the draft, address it to people, hand it
-- to `transition_plan`. The seed has done it this way since 0003.
--
-- Everything arriving here is already resolved. The presets, the default
-- deadline and the default quorum are `packages/domain`'s — `resolvePreset`,
-- `defaultDeadline`, `quorumFor` — and the Edge Function applies them before
-- calling. This function does not second-guess those numbers; it records them,
-- and the table's own constraints (a viable band, a deadline before the last
-- possible start) are what stop an impossible plan.
--
-- The short code is generated here for the reason `create_circle` generates
-- one: a collision has to be retried against the table, which only the database
-- can see.
--
-- In `public`, although it is planning's work and calls planning's machine.
-- Two reasons, and either alone would settle it: PostgREST exposes `public` and
-- nothing else, so a function anywhere else cannot be called by a client at all;
-- and `070_communication_jobs.sql` asserts that *no* function outside `public` is
-- callable by a client role, which is the invariant that keeps `planning`,
-- `private` and `jobs` reachable only through functions like this one. What
-- stays in `planning` is what only SQL calls: `transition_plan`, `allowed_keys`,
